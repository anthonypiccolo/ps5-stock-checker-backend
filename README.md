### Disord

The discord bot is built in python and utlizes discord.py which is a wrapper currently in the process of being sunset. ETA for the sunset is ~2022 sometime. Ye be warned. 

Basically, it activates a bot and the bot will post a message to all channels it's part of. 

setup details I found useful:

- https://discord.com/developers/ - set up a developer team
